# Chimera
Python based bot core for IRC

### Early in Development
Chimera was started in July 2015 as a learning experience by Andromeda and Jobe. There is no final stage planned, but as an ongoing project that will change over time. We plan to work on this on occasion, not everyday so it will be a while before it's more than a hollow framework.

### Why Python?
Why not? Python's a great language, just a little different from most standardized formats such as C or even PHP. It does take some getting used to, but it offers module loading and unloading and real time memory freeing... it's perfect for handling large amounts of varying data.
